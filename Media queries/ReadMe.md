##### The changes I have changed.

Adding media query for the devices start from 1024px (tablet is not including).
There was missing (:) in css ::before so the opacity will not run.
There was command overflow: hidden in the body element and that stopping the content in bigger size to been showing.
I have removed the height from body element because by default is page height.
